        <h2>Unit 2</h2>
        <p>Unit 2 Was Very Helpful For Us. We Learned How To Add Subtitles To Videos. Being Able To Add Subtitles To Videos Helps People Who Can't Hear Be Able TO Understand What Is Going On In The Video. Without Adding The Subtitles Some People Would'nt Be Able To Understand What Is Going On.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Common HTML Tags</li>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Links for internal and external sites</li>
            <li>Tables</li>
            <li>Adding videos -<a href="video.html">Video</a></li>
            <li>Adding captions</li>
        </ul> 
            
        <h2>Unit 3</h2>
        <p>Unit 3 Was A Useful Unit For Us To Learn. It Taught Us How To Add Style And Color To Our Website And How To Make It Look Nice When We Do. This Unit Also Taught Us The Importance Of Using Color, Its Important Because Without Color Our Website Would Look Plain And Boring.</p>

        <h2>Unit 4</h2>
        <p>Unit 4 Had Some Helpful Things To Learn About. We First Started Off With Learning About Web Graphics, Then We Learned About Copyright Law And More Graphics, Then We Made Sure That We Understand Web Graphics, We Soon Learned How To Acquire Images For Web Graphics, And We Learned How To Crop And Resize An Image Last. I Think The Most Important Ones That We Learned Out Of This Lesson is,</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Crop And Resizing An Image</li>
            <li>Copyright Law</li>
            <li>Making Sure That We Understood What Web Graphics Are Good And How We Use Them</li>
